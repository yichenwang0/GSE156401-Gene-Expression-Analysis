# MEK5-Mediated Gene Expression Changes in PC3 Prostate Cancer Cells

This repository contains code and documentation for analyzing a publicly available dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The dataset includes gene expression measurements in PC3 human prostate cancer cells expressing a scrambled shRNA (shControl) or MEK5 shRNA, with three replicates for each condition. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE156401).

## Project Overview  

The analysis pipeline includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Checking for outlier samples.
2. **Gene Filtering**: Removing genes with low expression values.
3. **Feature Selection**: Utilizing the empirical Bayes method for identifying significant genes with multiplicity adjustment.
4. **Sample Visualization**: Visualizing samples in two-dimensional space with clustering and dimensionality reduction methods.
5. **Classification**: Predicting sample classes based on gene expression profiles using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
6. **Functional Annotation of Top Discriminant Genes**: Exploring the biological relevance of top discriminant genes.
